      "text": "In the ancient age of gods and demons, there lived a buffalo demon named Mahishasura. He was ambitious and power-hungry, and he performed severe penance to please Lord Brahma, the creator. For years he stood on one leg, ate nothing, and meditated through scorching heat and freezing cold. Impressed by his dedication, Brahma appeared before him. 'Ask for any boon,' Brahma said."

      "text": "Mahishasura was clever. He asked, 'Grant me that no god, demon, or man can ever defeat me.' Brahma granted the wish. But Mahishasura did not think to mention women — for in his arrogance, he believed no woman could ever challenge him. Armed with this boon, Mahishasura gathered a massive army of demons and attacked heaven itself. The Devas fought bravely, but they were no match for the invincible demon."

      "text": "One by one, the gods were defeated. Indra lost his throne. Surya, the sun god, was dimmed. Vayu, the wind god, was silenced. Mahishasura sat upon Indra's throne and declared himself the ruler of all three worlds — heaven, earth, and the netherworld. Darkness and cruelty spread everywhere. The desperate gods gathered and went to Lord Vishnu, Lord Shiva, and Lord Brahma for help."

      "heading": "The Birth of Durga",
      "text": "The three great gods combined their divine energies in a blazing column of light. From that radiance emerged a magnificent goddess — Durga. She had ten arms and eyes that blazed like fire. Each god contributed a powerful weapon: Shiva gave his trident, Vishnu his chakra, Vayu his bow and arrows, Himalaya gave her a fierce lion to ride, and Agni bestowed his spear. Adorned with celestial ornaments and armed to the teeth, Durga was the embodiment of Shakti — supreme power."

      "heading": "The Nine-Day Battle",
      "text": "Durga rode into battle on her lion, her war cry shaking the three worlds. Mahishasura sent wave after wave of demons — thousands of fearsome warriors. Durga fought them all, her ten arms wielding weapons in a dazzling blur. The battle raged for nine days and nine nights. Each day, Durga destroyed another legion of Mahishasura's army. The demon himself kept changing forms — from buffalo to lion to elephant to warrior — trying to confuse and overpower her."

      "heading": "The Final Strike",
      "text": "On the tenth day, Mahishasura charged at Durga in his mightiest buffalo form. The earth shook under his hooves. But Durga leapt upon him, pinning him under her foot. As he tried to shift into yet another form, she drove her trident through him with unstoppable force. The mighty Mahishasura fell. The heavens lit up, flowers rained from the sky, and the gods rejoiced."

      "heading": "Victory of Good",
      "text": "The Devas regained their places, light returned to the world, and peace was restored. From that day, Durga was celebrated as Mahishasura Mardini — the slayer of Mahishasura. Every year, during the nine nights of Navratri, we honor Goddess Durga and celebrate her victory on the tenth day — Vijayadashami. Her story reminds us that when evil seems unstoppable, the power of righteousness, united and fearless, will always prevail."
