      "text": "In ancient times, the Devas — the gods of heaven — and the Asuras — the powerful demons — were locked in an endless struggle for power. The Devas had grown weak after a sage's curse drained their strength. Desperate for a solution, they turned to Lord Vishnu, the preserver of the universe. Vishnu smiled and said, 'There is a way. Deep within the cosmic ocean lies the Amrit — the nectar of immortality. Whoever drinks it will never die.'"

      "text": "But churning the vast ocean was no small task. Even the mighty Devas could not do it alone. Vishnu advised them to form a truce with the Asuras. 'Tell them you will share the Amrit,' he said. 'Together, you will have the strength to churn the ocean.' Reluctantly, the Devas approached their enemies. The Asuras, tempted by the promise of immortality, agreed to help."

      "heading": "The Great Churning Begins",
      "text": "They uprooted the towering Mount Mandara and placed it in the center of the ocean as a churning rod. The great serpent Vasuki volunteered to serve as the churning rope, wrapping his enormous body around the mountain. The Asuras grabbed Vasuki's head, and the Devas held his tail. Back and forth they pulled, spinning the mountain with tremendous force. The ocean began to froth and swirl."

      "heading": "Vishnu to the Rescue",
      "text": "Suddenly, Mount Mandara began to sink into the ocean floor under its own weight! The churning came to a halt, and everyone watched in dismay. But Lord Vishnu took the form of a giant tortoise — Kurma — and dove beneath the mountain. He placed the mountain on his broad back, giving it a steady base. With renewed energy, the Devas and Asuras resumed their churning."

      "heading": "Wonders from the Deep",
      "text": "As the churning continued, extraordinary treasures emerged from the ocean one by one. First came Kamadhenu, the wish-fulfilling cow. Then appeared Airavata, the majestic white elephant. The divine tree Kalpavriksha rose from the waters, followed by Goddess Lakshmi herself, radiant and beautiful, who chose Lord Vishnu as her companion. Precious gems, celestial weapons, and divine beings all emerged from the swirling depths."

      "text": "But not everything that emerged was good. A terrible poison called Halahala burst from the ocean, so deadly that it could destroy all of creation. The sky turned dark, and everyone trembled in fear. Lord Shiva stepped forward. He scooped up the poison and drank it all. Goddess Parvati quickly pressed her hand against his throat to stop the poison from spreading. The poison turned his throat blue, which is why Shiva is called Neelkanth — the blue-throated one."

      "heading": "The Nectar of Immortality",
      "text": "Finally, Dhanvantari — the divine physician — emerged from the ocean carrying a golden pot of Amrit. The Asuras immediately tried to snatch it. But Lord Vishnu took the enchanting form of Mohini and cleverly distributed the Amrit only to the Devas. Strengthened by the nectar, the Devas reclaimed their power. The great churning of the ocean taught everyone that even impossible tasks can be achieved when you work together with patience and determination."
